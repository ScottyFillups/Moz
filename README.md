Simple multiplayer boulder dodging game. Play it here: http://tabijs.herokuapp.com

Implemented with a non-authoritative server using socket.io. Hopefully in the (near?) future, data will be transferred via P2P using simple-peer, with socket.io only being used for signalling and the game lobby. Stay tuned!
